	abstract = {Plastic production began in the early 1900s and it has transformed our way of life. Despite the many advantages of plastics, a massive amount of plastic waste is generated each year, threatening the environment and human health. Because of their pervasiveness and potential for health consequences, small plastic residues produced by the breakdown of larger particles have recently received considerable attention. Plastic particles at the nanometer scale (nanoplastics) are more easily absorbed, ingested, or inhaled and translocated to other tissues and organs than larger particles. Nanoplastics can also be transferred through the food web and between generations, have an influence on cellular function and physiology, and increase infections and disease susceptibility. This review will focus on current research on the toxicity of nanoplastics to aquatic species, taking into account their interactive effects with complex environmental mixtures and multiple stressors. It intends to summarize the cellular and molecular effects of nanoplastics on aquatic species; discuss the carrier effect of nanoplastics in the presence of single or complex environmental pollutants, pathogens, and weathering/aging processes; and include environmental stressors, such as temperature, salinity, pH, organic matter, and food availability, as factors influencing nanoplastic toxicity. Microplastics studies were also included in the discussion when the data with NPs were limited. Finally, this review will address knowledge gaps and critical questions in plastics’ ecotoxicity to contribute to future research in the field.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we describe how human activities change the abundance and quality of terrestrial habitats and discuss the ecological implications of these changes for biota. We begin by identifying fundamental principles associated with human conversion of terrestrial habitats and how fauna and flora respond to habitat conversion. We present a number of examples of how landscape ecologists and conservation biologists use these basic principles of land-cover change to develop management strategies to minimize ecological impacts from habitat loss. Next, we discuss principles for applying landscape ecology. We identify major voids in ecological theory and existing data that need to be filled for land managers to be better prepared to apply the principles of landscape ecology to biological conservation. Finally, we suggest research approaches that may be used to fill knowledge gaps. Although social and economic considerations are fundamental to landcover change dynamics (Riebsame et al. 1994), detailed discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of this book; therefore, we focus our remarks on the ecological aspects of human conversion of terrestrial habitats.},

	abstract = {This book covers various aspects of aquatic animal health, such as pathogenic and beneficial microbes, disease diagnosis, treatment and preventive measures, biosecurity, disease management. The environmental factors affecting aquatic animal well-being and their nutritional requirements are also discussed. Finally, emerging trends, and future research and management directions are also concluded in this book.Aquatic animals are a crucial source of nutrition for people worldwide, as they provide at least 20\% of animal protein intake for over 3 billion individuals, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Furthermore, fishing and aquaculture industries generate employment and income for millions, particularly in developing countries. However, pollution, habitat destruction, overfishing, climate change, and disease outbreaks pose a threat to aquatic animal health. Disease outbreaks and pathogenic microbes can cause significant harm, necessitating immediate attention. Addressing this issue requires multifaceted approach that includes enhancing water quality, managing animal stress levels, improving biosecurity measures, and practicing responsible aquaculture techniques. Finally, collaboration between government, industry, and researchers is critical to developing new and effective strategies for mitigating the impact of disease outbreaks on aquatic animal health. This book provides concise information for students, teachers, researchers, and academicians interested in the field of aquatic animal health. It also serves as a reference book to administrators, practitioners, stakeholders, and non-professionals interested in sustainable aquatic animal health management.},
